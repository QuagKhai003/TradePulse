config.py — pilot-scope constants for the ETL.
@context  Single source of the pilot vertical, destination markets, and signal thresholds.
          Everything scope-related lives here so widening a vertical is a config edit (plan §3).
@done     HS codes, market->reporter map (VN/EN names), partner codes, flow default, noise
          floors + signal bands (plan §6).
@todo     Add second vertical + markets when Stage 0 GO picks them.
@limits   PURE data. No I/O, no imports beyond stdlib typing.
@affects  Consumed by pipeline, transform, signals, and the web snapshot export.
